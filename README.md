# What is this?

Hacker Simulator is a program where you simulate hacking. Wow.

# How to use

Every time you press a key, you hack! The program will show cool-looking code on the screen. Depending on the settings, Access Denied and Access Granted prompts can appear and Action Complete prompts can make it seem like you are finally done!

There are also other settings, most notably being High Contrast Mode. I personally like this a lot. It pretty much distinguishes greens from each other. Normally, Access Granted appears a slightly lighter green than the rest of the code. This setting makes Access Granted blue. Whoa. You can edit settings in the .ini file that comes with the program.
